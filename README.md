## Abstract

Object knowledge is bound together in semantic networks that can be spatially represented. How these knowledge representations shape and are in turn shaped by learning remains unclear. Here, we directly examined how object similarity representations impact implicit learning of feature dimensions and how learning, in turn, influences these representations. In a pre-experiment, 237 adult participants arranged object-pictures in a spatial arena, revealing semantic relatedness of everyday objects across categories: activity, fashion, and foods. The subsequent experiment assessed whether these semantic relationships played a role in implicitly learning specific object features in a separate adult participant group (N=82). Participants inferred the meanings of two pseudo-words through feedback. Using computational modeling, we tested various learning strategies and established that learning was guided by semantic relationships quantified in the pre-experiment. Post-learning arrangements reflected object similarity representations as well as the learned feature. We directly show that similarity representations guide implicit learning and that learning in turn reshapes existing knowledge representations.

### General description

The top level directories correspond to the two experiments (pre- and main). Within each of the two folders 01_Pre_experiment and 02_Main_experiment are Matlab and R project folders. Each of these contain folders for data, functions, and scripts for processing and analysis. 

In the pre-experiment, we combine data from three different platforms: Redcap, where the main survey was run, Meadows, which hosted the multiarrangement task (MAT), and Prolific, for metadata on the participant sample. In the main experiment, we combine data from those three sources with data from Psiturk, the platform that hosted the feature identification task. 

In each of the scripts folders, the files follow a naming convention that indicates to which experiment it belongs and in what order they should be run. For example, the script 'ns_13_pca_for_rdm.m' contains the code '13' indicating that this script belongs to the pre-experiment (1) and should be run third (3) in sequence; the script 'ns_25_regression_prep.m' indicates that it belongs to the main experiment (2) and should be run fifth in sequence (5).

In the third folder (02_Main_experiment_computational_modeling) there are matlab scripts that call the fitting functions and Matlab toolboxes mentioned above(spm12 and VBA toolboxes) which should be added to Funtions in order to fit and compare the different computational models. The simulation folder contains scripts and functions to generate data using the computational models tested and fit data to same models. The Data folder contains the data structure from the 02_Main_experiment and resorted structure for the modeling pipeline as well as output structures after model fitting. Note that the order of scripts is denoted in the same way as explained above

The script files' names generally refer to their purpose. For example, 'ns_22_organize_learning_data.m' is responsible for organizing the preprocessed data yielded from 'ns_21_get_data.m', which itself reads in and concatenates the raw data prior to preprocessing.

Raw data are .json and .csv files and contained within the Matlab folders within each experiment's directory. .mat and .csv files contained in the Data folders are in most cases generated by the analysis scripts. Other files are used as reference structures for data wrangling and processing.
